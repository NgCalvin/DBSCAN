# DBSCAN

This project is to implement a basic DBSCAN in Python 3, start from stretch.

## Data Format

The expected data format would be 2D points separated by lines, while each line
is like:

```
[x-coordinate]<tab>[y-coordinate]
```

The testing data is [a spiral-shaped data](./data/points), which is obtained
from [here](http://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/datasets/spiral.txt).

## How to execute

**Make sure you are running on Python 3.6+.**

```
# python dbscan.py <RADIUS> <MIN_POINTS> <DATA_FILE>
```
